## Every web developer should ask himself many questions before designing the website, let’s talking about these questions.


***WHO IS THE SITE FOR?***

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.


***WHY PEOPLE VISIT YOUR WEBSITE?***

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.
You should know if the website is for individuals or for on company, this helps you to know how you can do your work perfectly many things such as ages or age range of the targeted people, what is the average of their income, the size of the company and their budget. 


- Key Motivations such as:
 Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
- Specific Goals:
Are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?

***What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?***

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.
First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site, let’s check two of them:
1.	Jasper had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney, Australia, and wants to make a complaint
1.	Ivy is a picture editor and wants to look at a photographer's site to see examples of his work before deciding whether to commission him.


***What Information Your Visitors Need?***
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.
You may want to offer additional supporting information that you think they might find helpful. Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals.


***HOW OFTEN PEOPLE WILL VISIT YOUR SITE?***


Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.
A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly (such as domestic plumbing or double glazing).


***SITE MAPS***
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
