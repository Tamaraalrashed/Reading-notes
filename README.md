# What-I-know-about-Text-Editors
I was asked to write about what I know about text editors, but actually I don’t have a strong base to tell you my friend about this topic! 
In the upcoming paragraphs I’ll try my best to make myself and you having some information I got from a specialist in this field, and I hope you can understand everything I’ll mention.
The text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
Every computer will come with its own text editor, such as notepad on windows, while you certainly can use Notepad to make websites, there are other text editors available that might help you code more efficiently. So, I want to mention a third-party text editor: Notepad ++, visual studio code, Atom, and brackets.
While the basic text editors don’t have the enough and necessary features for coding such as code completion which is saving time, the coding text editors was more efficient. 
Talking about text editors, I should tell you about IDE(Integrated Development Environment), is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
