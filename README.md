### We also need tables in our job, here is a one :

Day          | Work
------------ | -------------
Sunday       | Drawing the Villa
Monday       | Meeting with the owner
Tuesday | Making the required modifications

***
We can add links like https://www.google.com/ just by copying the URL without doing any other code.
