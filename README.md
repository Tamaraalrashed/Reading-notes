# **Growth Mindset**
I've heard these words from more than one programmer, they said ***"We love problems, we are problems' solvers!"***

So, I need to grow my mindset, which will help me to be more creative and to achieve more & higher goals. The most clear idea about growth mindset that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed.

To keep up with the right way for growth mindset, I â€˜ve some reminders make me more persevering:

- **No pain, No gain** , which forced me to pay more efforts.
-  **Donâ€™t** avoid ***CHALLENGES***.
-  **Success** of the others is inspiring and motivating me.
