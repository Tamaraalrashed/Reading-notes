# ***Java Script***

## _We need to open a website and use it easily, in other words we need something to interact with us while browsing, the anonymous soldier whose responsibility is that interactive is JAVA SCRIPT LANGUAGE which we will talk about:_

-  **ACCESS CONTENT**: *You can use JavaScript to select any element attribute , or text from an HTML page .*
- **MODIFY CONTENT**: *You can use JavaScript to add elements , attributes , and text to the page , or remove them . *
- **PROGRAM RULES**: *You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow ( like a recipe ) . which allows it to access or change the content of a page .*
- **REACT TO EVENTS**: *You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred . For example , it could be run when:*
  - A button is pressed.
  - A link is clicked ( or tapped ) on .
  - A cursor hovers over an element.
  - Information is added to a form.
  - An interval of time has passed.
  - A web page has finished loading.

  ## ***A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal .***

  *Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step - by - step .* <br>
  *A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page .*<br>
  *Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them .*

  ## ***Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve , and break that down into smaller steps:***
   1.  DEFINE THE GOAL First , you need to define the task you want to achieve . You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
   1. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle . This can be represented using a flowchart . You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task ( and any information it needs to perform the task ) , rather like writing a recipe that it can follow .
   1. CODE EACH STEP: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands.In our case , this is JavaScript.

   ## ***EXPRESSIONS***
   <br>
    An expression evaluates into ( results in a single value . Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions :
   <br>
   1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
   <br>
   > For example: var color = ' beige ' ; The value of color is now beige.
   1. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
   > For example : var area = 3 * 2 ; The value of area is now 6.
   <br>

   ## ***OPERATORS***
   <br>
    Expressions rely on things called operators ; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

   ### ***ARITHMETIC OPERATORS***

   ### ***STRING OPERATOR There is just one string operator : the + symbol . It is used to join the strings on either side of it .***

   >For example , you might have a first and last name in two separate variables and want to join them to show a full name . In this example , the variable called fullName would hold the string ' Ivy Stone'.

    ## ***FUNCTIONS & METHODS*** 
    ### ***Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task . A method is the same as a function , except methods are created inside and are part of an object.***
    ### ***Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task . If different parts of a script repeat the same task , you can reuse the function .***
