# Ethics in workplace

### In this reading I chose from ethics in the workplace "Google and AI" to read about it, and will give a summarization of it .  <br>

It's talking about Google's use of artificial intelligence.<br>

Employees at the company have spent months protesting Google’s involvement in Project Maven,sending a letter to Pichai(Google CEO ) demanding that Google terminate its contract with the Department of Defense. <br>


Despite Google’s commitment not to use AI to build weapons, employees questioned whether the principles would explicitly prohibit Google from pursuing a government contract like Maven in the future. <br>

Academics and students in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence joined Google employees in voicing concerns about Project Maven, arguing that Google was unethically paving the way for the creation of fully autonomous weapons.<br>

It’s unclear now whether bidding on the JEDI contract would amount to a violation of Google’s newly announced principles—or whether the Pentagon would consider partnering with Google again after the company backed away from Maven. <br>


”Ultimately,Google will have to offer more public transparency as to the systems they build. Otherwise we will continue to rely on the conscientious employees wiling to risk their positions in Google to ensure the company ‘does no evil.’”  a professor at The New School and one of the authors of an open letter that calls on Google to cancel its Maven contract said.<br>

For me, I am totally agree with google employees and respect their ethics to prevent using google's AI for military reasons especially for weapons! <br>
